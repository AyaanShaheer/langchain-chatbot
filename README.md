# Custom Chatbot using Langchain and Flask

This project implements a custom chatbot utilizing the Langchain framework and Flask web framework. The chatbot is designed to provide information about technical courses extracted from the [Brainlox website](https://brainlox.com/courses/category/technical).

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Automatically fetches course information from the specified URL using a web scraping loader.
- **Embeddings**: Creates vector embeddings of the extracted documents using OpenAIâ€™s embeddings model, enabling efficient similarity search.
- **RESTful API**: Exposes a simple RESTful API using Flask to handle user queries and provide relevant course information.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language for the entire application.
- **Langchain**: A framework for building language model applications.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for creating the API.
- **FAISS**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
